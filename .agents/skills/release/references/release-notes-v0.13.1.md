## What's New in v0.13.1

v0.13.1 rewrites how Ainotate works with OpenCode's plan mode. The plugin now intercepts plan mode, injects its own planning workflow, and gives OpenCode users the same interactive browser-based review that Claude Code and Pi users already have. This release also fixes an Obsidian save failure on certain Bun versions.

### OpenCode Plan Mode Rewrite

Previous versions of the OpenCode plugin had a fragile plan mode integration. Long plans caused JSON parse errors because the entire plan was passed as a tool call string argument. The agent wrote to a custom directory that OpenCode's permission system blocked. The browser review UI often failed to open. There was no support for the agent asking clarifying questions during planning.

This release replaces all of that with file-based plan storage. The agent writes its plan to a markdown file on disk, then calls `submit_plan` with the file path. Plans live in `~/.local/share/opencode/plans/`, which is the XDG data path that OpenCode's permission system already allows. The agent picks the filename, and on feedback it revises the same file and resubmits. No content is lost between rounds.

The planning prompt now follows an exploration-first workflow: Explore the codebase, ask clarifying questions, write the plan, submit for review. Previously, agents would jump straight into writing a plan before understanding the code. For greenfield tasks where there is no codebase to explore, the agent skips to questions. The prompt is tool-neutral and avoids referencing specific tool names like `write` or `edit`, so it works with GPT models that use `apply_patch`.

Under the hood, the plugin strips OpenCode's native "STRICTLY FORBIDDEN: ANY file edits" directive from the system prompt and replaces it with Ainotate's own scoped rules, which allow the agent to create and edit plan files while still preventing codebase modifications. The `submit_plan` tool is hidden from subagents by default; users running custom subagent workflows like Superpowers or OhMyOpenCode can set `AINOTATE_ALLOW_SUBAGENTS=1` to make it visible.

Shared checklist utilities were extracted to `@ainotate/shared` for cross-plugin reuse of plan execution tracking.

### Obsidian Save Fix

Bun versions 1.1.43 through 1.1.45 introduced a regression where `mkdirSync({ recursive: true })` throws `EEXIST` when the directory already exists. This broke Obsidian saves on the second attempt. The fix adds an `existsSync` guard before the mkdir call. It's a no-op on unaffected Bun versions and prevents the save failure on affected ones.
