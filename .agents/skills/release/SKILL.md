description: Prepare and execute a Ainotate release — draft release notes with full contributor credit, bump versions across all package files, build in dependency order, and kick off the tag-driven release pipeline. Use this skill whenever the user mentions preparing a release, bumping versions, writing release notes, tagging a release, or publishing. Also trigger when the user says things like "let's ship", "prep a release", "what's changed since last release", or "time to cut a new version".

# Ainotate Release

The process has four phases. Phase 1 (release notes) is where most of the work happens — present the draft for review before proceeding to later phases.

## Phase 1: Draft Release Notes

This is the most important phase. The release notes are the public face of each version and the primary way the community sees their contributions recognized.

### Step 1: Determine scope

1. Find the latest release tag: `git tag --sort=-v:refname | head -1`
2. Determine the new version number. Ask the user if unclear (patch, minor, or major).
3. Gather all changes since the last tag:
   - `git log --oneline <last-tag>..HEAD` for commit history
   - `git log --merges --oneline <last-tag>..HEAD` for merged PRs
4. For each PR, use `gh pr view <number> --json title,author,body,closedIssues,labels` to get details.

### Step 2: Research contributors

This is critical. Every person who participated in the release gets credit — not just PR authors.

For each PR and linked issue, collect:
- **PR authors** — the person who wrote the code
- **Issue reporters** — who filed the bug or feature request
- **Issue commenters** — who participated in the discussion with useful context
- **Discussion creators** — who started relevant GitHub Discussions
- **Feature requestors** — check the linked "closes #N" issues and their authors

Use the GitHub API via `gh`:
```bash
# Get issue details including author
gh issue view <number> --json author,title,body

# Get issue comments to find participants
gh api repos/backnotprop/ainotate/issues/<number>/comments --jq '.[].user.login'

# Get PR review comments
gh api repos/backnotprop/ainotate/pulls/<number>/comments --jq '.[].user.login'
```

### Step 3: Write the release notes

Read the reference release notes in `references/` for the canonical template structure. These are real release notes from previous versions — match their tone, structure, and level of detail.

- `release-notes-v0.13.0.md` — large release, 14 PRs, 3 first-time contributors, "New Contributors" + narrative "Contributors" section
- `release-notes-v0.12.0.md` — large community release, 14 PRs, 10 external, detailed narrative "Contributors" section
- `release-notes-v0.13.1.md` — small patch release, 2 PRs, no external authors, "Community" section focused on issue reporters

Pay attention to how each reference handles contributor crediting differently. Pick the pattern that fits the release's contributor profile — a release with many external PRs warrants a narrative "Contributors" section; a patch driven by issue reports uses a lighter "Community" section.

Write the file to the repo root as `RELEASE_NOTES_v<VERSION>.md`.

#### Structure

1. **X/Twitter follow link** — first line, always the same:
   ```
   Follow [@ainotate](https://x.com/ainotate) on X for updates
   ```

2. **"Missed recent releases?"** collapsible table — copy from the previous release's notes, then:
   - Add the previous release (the one you're succeeding) as the newest row
   - Keep roughly 10-12 rows; drop the oldest if needed
   - Each row: version link + comma-separated feature highlights (short phrases)

3. **"What's New in vX.Y.Z"** — the heart of the notes
   - Open with 1-3 sentences summarizing the release theme and scope. Mention how many PRs, how many from external contributors, any first-timers.
   - Each major feature/fix gets its own `###` subsection with:
     - A descriptive heading (not the PR title verbatim — rephrase for clarity)
     - 1-4 paragraphs explaining what changed and why it matters. Be specific and concrete. Describe the problem that existed before, what the change does, and how users experience it.
     - Credit line at the bottom: PR link, linked issues with `closing [#N]`, and contributor attribution
   - Minor changes go under `### Additional Changes` as bold-titled bullets

4. **Install / Update** — standard block, read from the previous release notes and reuse verbatim

5. **"What's Changed"** — bullet list of every PR in the release:
   ```
   - feat: descriptive PR title by @author in [#N](url)
   ```

6. **"New Contributors"** — if any first-time contributors:
   ```
   - @username made their first contribution in [#N](url)
   ```

7. **"Contributors" or "Community"** — narrative section recognizing everyone who participated:
   - PR authors get a sentence about what they built
   - Issue reporters and commenters get listed with what they reported/discussed
   - Group community issue reporters in a bullet list at the end

8. **Full Changelog link**:
   ```
   **Full Changelog**: https://github.com/backnotprop/ainotate/compare/<prev-tag>...<new-tag>
   ```

#### Writing guidelines

- **Narrative over noise.** Write in clear, readable prose. Not marketing-speak, not changelog-dump. Explain what changed and why someone should care, in plain language.
- **Bullets where they help.** Use bullet lists for enumerating discrete items (additional changes, contributor lists). Use paragraphs for explaining features.
- **No cliches or buzzwords.** Don't say "exciting", "game-changing", "seamless", "powerful". Just describe what happened.
- **No punchlines.** Don't end sections with a clever quip or a summary zinger. Let the feature speak for itself.
- **Speak through practical benefit.** Describe what changed and what it means for the user in concrete, reliable terms. Not aspirational, not hype — just what it does.
- **Don't overuse em dashes.** One or two per release is fine. If you notice them stacking up, restructure the sentence instead.
- **Grammatical structure matters.** Vary sentence structure. Active voice. Concrete subjects and verbs.
- **Contributor tags.** Use `@username` — bare at-mentions, not markdown links like `[@user](url)`. GitHub renders bare `@mentions` with avatar icons in release notes. This is important for community recognition.
- **Every contributor counts.** Everyone who filed an issue, left a comment that shaped a decision, or participated in a discussion gets mentioned. This project's community is its lifeblood.

### Step 4: Present for review

Write the draft to `RELEASE_NOTES_v<VERSION>.md` in the repo root and tell the user it's ready for review. Do not `git add` or commit this file — release notes are kept untracked by design. Wait for their feedback before proceeding to Phase 2.

---

## Phase 2: Version Bump

Bump the version string in these **7 files** (and only these — other package.json files use stub versions):

| File | Field |
|------|-------|
| `package.json` (root) | `"version"` |
| `apps/opencode-plugin/package.json` | `"version"` |
| `apps/pi-extension/package.json` | `"version"` |
| `apps/hook/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` | `"version"` |
| `apps/copilot/plugin.json` | `"version"` |
| `openpackage.yml` (root) | `version:` |
| `packages/server/package.json` | `"version"` |

Read each file, confirm the current version matches expectations, then update all 7 atomically.

Do not bump the VS Code extension (`apps/vscode-extension/package.json`) — it has independent versioning.

---

## Phase 3: Build

Run builds in dependency order:

```bash
bun run build:review    # 1. Code review editor (standalone Vite build)
bun run build:hook      # 2. Plan review + hook server (copies review's built HTML into hook dist)
bun run build:opencode  # 3. OpenCode plugin (copies built HTML from hook + review)
bun run build:pi        # 4. Pi extension (chains review → hook → pi internally, safe to run after 1-2)
```

`build:pi` chains review and hook internally, so after steps 1-2 it only runs the pi-specific build.

Verify all builds succeed before proceeding.

### Pi Parity Gate

After builds pass, audit the Pi extension to ensure all server-side imports resolve in the published package. This catches missing files before they reach npm.

1. **Check imports vs `files` array.** Trace all local imports (starting with `./` or `../`) from `index.ts`, `server.ts`, `tool-scope.ts`, and every file in `server/`. Verify each target is covered by a pattern in the `files` array of `apps/pi-extension/package.json`.

2. **Check `vendor.sh` covers all shared/ai imports.** Every `../generated/*.js` import in the server files must have a corresponding entry in `vendor.sh`'s copy loops. If a new shared module or AI module was added to `packages/shared/` or `packages/ai/` and is imported by Pi's server code, it must be added to `vendor.sh`.

3. **Dry-run the pack.** Run `cd apps/pi-extension && bun pm pack --dry-run` and verify the output includes every file the server imports. Look specifically for any newly added files since the last release.

4. **Quick smoke test.** Confirm `generated/` contains all expected files after build, especially any new ones (e.g., a new shared module added in this release cycle).

If anything is missing, fix it before proceeding to Phase 4. Common fixes:
- Add the file to `vendor.sh`'s copy loop
- Add the file or directory to the `files` array in `package.json`
- Add an import path fix (Pi uses `../generated/` not `@ainotate/shared` or `@ainotate/ai`)

---

## Phase 4: Commit, Tag, and Release

1. **Commit the version bump:**
   ```
   chore: bump version to X.Y.Z
   ```
   Stage only the 7 version-bumped files. Do not stage the release notes file (it's untracked by design).

2. **Create and push the tag:**
   ```bash
   git tag vX.Y.Z
   git push origin main
   git push origin vX.Y.Z
   ```
   The `v*` tag push triggers the release pipeline (`.github/workflows/release.yml`).

3. **The pipeline handles everything else:**
   - Runs tests
   - Cross-compiles binaries for 6 platforms (macOS ARM64/x64, Linux x64/ARM64, Windows x64/ARM64)
   - Compiles paste service binaries (same 6 platforms)
   - Generates SLSA build provenance attestations for all 12 binaries via `actions/attest-build-provenance` (signed through Sigstore, recorded in Rekor)
   - Creates the GitHub Release with all binaries attached
   - Publishes `@ainotate/opencode` and `@ainotate/pi-extension` to npm with provenance

   **Note on immutable releases:** The repo has GitHub Immutable Releases enabled, so once the `v*` tag is pushed and the release is created, the tag→commit and tag→asset bindings are permanent. You cannot delete and re-create a tag to "fix" a bad release — you must ship a new version. Release notes remain editable (see step 5), but everything else is locked.

4. **Monitor the pipeline:**
   Watch the release workflow run until it completes:
   ```bash
   gh run list --workflow=release.yml --limit=1
   gh run view <run-id> --log
   ```
   Verify:
   - All jobs pass (test, build, release, npm-publish)
   - The GitHub Release was created with all binary artifacts
   - npm packages published successfully (check with `npm view @ainotate/opencode version` and `npm view @ainotate/pi-extension version`)

   If anything fails, investigate the logs and report to the user before retrying.

5. **Replace the release notes:**
   Once the release is live and verified, replace the auto-generated notes body with the drafted release notes:
   ```bash
   gh release edit vX.Y.Z --notes-file RELEASE_NOTES_v<VERSION>.md
   ```
