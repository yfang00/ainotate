/**
 * Lazy-resolution contract for ConfigStore.
 *
 * Tested on a FRESH instance (ConfigStoreForTest) rather than the module
 * singleton: whether the singleton has already resolved depends on which test
 * files ran first in the process, which made a singleton-based version of this
 * test flaky in CI. The contract under test is the mechanism itself:
 * construction resolves NOTHING — a host StorageBackend installed before the
 * first settings access receives the initial resolution reads and the
 * default-seeding writes. A configured host therefore never gets
 * ainotate-* cookies written to its origin.
