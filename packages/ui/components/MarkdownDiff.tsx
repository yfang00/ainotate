/* Theme-bridging shim around @plannotator/markdown-editor's MarkdownDiff — the
   frozen two-revision comparison surface (newer revision as the real document,
   deletions projected struck-through in place). Same pattern as the
   MarkdownEditor shim: resolve the color mode from ThemeProvider beneath the
   host's provider and pass it down as a prop.

   The byte contract lives on `editorHandleRef`: getMarkdown() returns the
   exact `modifiedMarkdown` supplied, getOriginalMarkdown() the exact
   `originalMarkdown` — both byte-identical to the inputs. The surface itself
   is frozen: document-changing transactions are rejected at the state and
   view boundaries, and the content DOM is contenteditable="false".

   `extensions` follows the editor's calling convention: CAPTURED ONCE per
   mounted comparison (keyed on `documentId` + both document strings) — pass a
   stable array and feed changing data through callbacks that close over live
   state. Build extensions against YOUR copy of the `@codemirror/*` packages;
   two live copies of `@codemirror/state` break the view. */
