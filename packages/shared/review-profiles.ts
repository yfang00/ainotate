/**
 * Review Profiles — shared contract types + prompt-composition spine.
 *
 * Runtime-agnostic: no node:fs, no node:http, no Bun APIs. The loader that
 * reads custom reviews from disk lives in packages/server/review-skill-loader.ts
 * and maps each curated Agent Skill into a ResolvedReviewProfile that this
 * module's composer renders. Vendored to Pi.
 *
 * A review profile is a named bundle of review intent. A custom review skill
 * fully replaces the provider's system prompt — picking a review runs that
 * review. The built-in default carries no instructions, so the composer falls
 * back to the provider prompt and the default review stays byte-for-byte today's.
 *
 * See docs/custom-reviews.md.

export const REPORTING_INSTRUCTIONS = `## Returning your findings

Hand back what you found as separate findings, not as one combined report.

- One finding per issue. Don't merge unrelated points into a single entry.
- Anchor each finding where it belongs:
  - About specific code? Give the file and the line(s), so it attaches to that spot in the diff.
  - About a whole file? Give the file and leave the line out.
  - A review-wide point? Leave out both the file and the line.
- Always produce the code-specific findings first.
- If your instructions also ask for a final verdict, summary, or overall judgment, add it as its own review-wide finding with no file and no line. The verdict is in addition to the specific findings, never a replacement for them.

If the instructions above told you to produce a particular report layout or document, that was for your own reasoning. For the final result, return findings in the structure described here: the specific code findings, plus any verdict as a separate review-wide finding.`;

 *
 * The skill body fully replaces the provider's system prompt — picking a review
 * runs that review. The reporting reminder is appended so the skill's findings
 * come back in Ainotate's shape (line/file/general) instead of one block.
 *
 * Built-in default (or any instruction-less profile):
 *   <provider immutable instructions>
 *   ---
 *   <user message>
 *
 * The default already states its own output contract, so it gets no reminder and
 * stays byte-identical to today's `systemPrompt + "\n\n---\n\n" + userMessage`.
