# Ainotate

A plan review UI for Claude Code that intercepts `ExitPlanMode` via hooks, letting users approve or request changes with annotated feedback. Also provides code review for git diffs and annotation of arbitrary markdown files.

> **Reusing the document UI (theme / markdown / editor / settings / comments / layout) in the commercial Workspaces app? Read `packages/ui/README.md` FIRST.** It explains the published `@ainotate/ui` + `@ainotate/core` packages and the host-override seams a host plugs its own backend into via `configureAinotateUI()`. A prior from-scratch reimplementation of this UI broke the app and was reverted — do **not** rebuild it or recreate `packages/document-ui`. Add a seam to `@ainotate/ui` instead, keep Ainotate's app unchanged, and never delete working code until a human confirms parity in the browser.

## Server Runtimes

There are two separate server implementations with the same API surface:

- **Bun server** (`packages/server/`) — used by both Claude Code (`apps/hook/`) and OpenCode (`apps/opencode-plugin/`). These plugins import directly from `@ainotate/server`.
- **Pi server** (`apps/pi-extension/server/`) — a standalone Node.js server for the Pi extension. It mirrors the Bun server's API but uses `node:http` primitives instead of Bun's `Request`/`Response` APIs.

When adding or modifying server endpoints, both implementations must be updated. Runtime-agnostic logic (store, validation, types) lives in `packages/shared/` and is imported by both.

## Installation

**Via plugin marketplace** (when repo is public):

```
/plugin marketplace add yfang00/ainotate
```

**Local testing:**

```bash
claude --plugin-dir ./apps/hook
```

## Environment Variables

| Variable | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| `AINOTATE_REMOTE` | Set to `1` / `true` for remote mode, `0` / `false` for local mode, or leave unset for SSH auto-detection. Uses a fixed port in remote mode; browser-opening behavior depends on the environment. |
| `AINOTATE_AGENT_TERMINAL_REMOTE` | Set to `1` / `true` to enable the annotate-mode agent terminal while `AINOTATE_REMOTE` is active. Off by default because remote mode binds beyond localhost. |
| `AINOTATE_PORT` | Fixed port to use. Default: random locally, `19432` for remote sessions. |
| `AINOTATE_BROWSER` | Custom browser to open plans in. macOS: app name or path. Linux/Windows: executable path. |
| `AINOTATE_SHARE` | Set to `disabled` to turn off URL sharing entirely. Default: enabled. Can also be set via `~/.ainotate/config.json` (`{ "share": "disabled" }`); the env var takes precedence. |
| `AINOTATE_SHARE_URL` | Custom base URL for share links (self-hosted portal). Default: `https://share.ainotate.ai`. |
| `AINOTATE_ORIGIN` | Explicit agent-origin override at the top of the detection chain. Valid values: `claude-code`, `amp`, `droid`, `opencode`, `codex`, `copilot-cli`, `gemini-cli`, `kiro-cli`, `pi`. Invalid values silently fall through to env-based detection. Unset by default. |
| `AINOTATE_JINA` | Set to `0` / `false` to disable Jina Reader for URL annotation, or `1` / `true` to enable. Default: enabled. Can also be set via `~/.ainotate/config.json` (`{ "jina": false }`) or per-invocation via `--no-jina`. |
| `AINOTATE_ANNOTATE_HISTORY` | Set to `0` / `false` to disable per-file version history in annotate mode (no copies of annotated files are written to the data dir; the annotate version diff is unavailable). Default: enabled. Can also be set via `~/.ainotate/config.json` (`{ "annotateHistory": false }`); the env var takes precedence. |
| `JINA_API_KEY` | Optional Jina Reader API key for higher rate limits (500 RPM vs 20 RPM unauthenticated). Free keys include 10M tokens. |
| `AINOTATE_DATA_DIR` | Override the base data directory. Supports `~` expansion. Default: `~/.ainotate`. All data (plans, history, drafts, config, hooks, sessions, debug logs, IPC registry) is stored under this directory. |
| `AINOTATE_FILE_BROWSER_MAX_FILES` | File-discovery limit: regular files inspected by CLI markdown/folder resolution and startup code-file warming, and supported files returned by the file browser. Must be a positive integer; invalid, zero, or negative values use the default of `5000`. |
| `AINOTATE_GLIMPSE` | Set to `0` / `false` to disable the Glimpse native window even when `glimpseui` is installed. Default: enabled. Can also be set via `~/.ainotate/config.json` (`{ "glimpse": false }`). |
| `AINOTATE_GLIMPSE_WIDTH` | Width in pixels for the Glimpse native window. Default: `1280`. |
| `AINOTATE_GLIMPSE_HEIGHT` | Height in pixels for the Glimpse native window. Default: `900`. |
| `AINOTATE_VERIFY_ATTESTATION` | **Read by the install scripts only**, not by the runtime binary. Set to `1` / `true` to have `scripts/install.sh` / `install.ps1` / `install.cmd` run `gh attestation verify` on every install. Off by default. Can also be set persistently via `~/.ainotate/config.json` (`{ "verifyAttestation": true }`) or per-invocation via `--verify-attestation`. Requires `gh` installed and authenticated. |
| `AINOTATE_SKIP_AGENT_TERMINAL_INSTALL` | Set to `1` / `true` to skip installing the managed Node/WebTUI runtime used by compiled Bun builds for the annotate-mode agent terminal. Read by `ainotate install-runtime agent-terminal`, which the installers call automatically. |
| `AINOTATE_MINIMAL` | **Read by the install scripts only**, not by the runtime binary. Set to `1` / `true` / `yes` to have `scripts/install.sh` / `install.ps1` / `install.cmd` install **only** the `ainotate` binary — skipping the sem sidecar, the agent-terminal runtime, and all per-agent skills, hooks, slash commands, and config. Equivalent to the `--minimal` (aliased `--binary-only`) flag; `--no-minimal` overrides it. Off by default. |
| `AINOTATE_SKIP_SEM_INSTALL` | **Read by the install scripts only.** Set to `1` / `true` to skip installing the optional `sem` semantic-diff sidecar (used by code review). Off by default. |

**Legacy:** `SSH_TTY` and `SSH_CONNECTION` are still detected when `AINOTATE_REMOTE` is unset. Set `AINOTATE_REMOTE=1` / `true` to force remote mode or `0` / `false` to force local mode.

**Devcontainer/SSH usage:**
```bash
export AINOTATE_REMOTE=1
export AINOTATE_PORT=9999
```

## Plan Review Flow

```
Claude calls ExitPlanMode
        ↓
PermissionRequest hook fires
        ↓
Bun server reads plan from stdin JSON (tool_input.plan)
        ↓
Server starts on random port, opens browser
        ↓
User reviews plan, optionally adds annotations
        ↓
Approve → stdout: {"hookSpecificOutput":{"decision":{"behavior":"allow"}}}
Deny    → stdout: {"hookSpecificOutput":{"decision":{"behavior":"deny","message":"..."}}}
```

## Code Review Flow

```
User runs /ainotate-review command
        ↓
Claude Code: ainotate review subcommand runs
OpenCode: event handler intercepts command
        ↓
VCS provider captures local changes (Git, GitButler, JJ, or P4 where supported). When review runs from a
non-VCS parent that contains nested Git/JJ/GitButler repos, child diffs are combined with
folder-prefixed paths.
        ↓
Review server starts, opens browser with diff viewer
        ↓
User annotates code, provides feedback
        ↓
Send Feedback → feedback sent to agent session
Approve → "LGTM" sent to agent session
```

### Since-main default review view

The default code-review diff is **`since-base`** — a composite of `merge-base(base, HEAD)` vs the working tree plus untracked files ("everything a PR would show if you committed and pushed now"). It renders as a three-section **git status** panel (Committed / Changes / Untracked) via `SectionsPanel`, with a `Git status | Tree | Commits` toggle (`PanelViewToggle`). The Commits segment (git-local sessions only) is a linear `--first-parent` history rail (`CommitsPanel`): clicking a commit opens its own diff (`commit:<sha>`, vs its first parent) as the all-files view headed by the commit message rendered as markdown. The toggle is fully SESSION-scoped — it never writes settings. The OPENING view is persisted in the cookie-only `reviewPanelView` config (`sections` | `tree` — never `commits`; the Commits view is session-only) and is written only by Settings and `ReviewSetupDialog`; the diff default lives in `defaultDiffType`. The persisted pair is coupled: the Sections view only renders `since-base`, so choosing a classic diff default snaps the persisted view to Tree and vice-versa (enforced in `ReviewSetupDialog`, the Settings Git tab, and the App first-run reset).

**Staging display invariant:** `useGitAdd`'s `stagedFiles` is the EFFECTIVE staged set (sections-sidecar snapshot + session stage/unstage overrides) and is the only source any surface may render staging state from. The sidecar entry's `staged` flag is a snapshot — ORing it back in makes files unstaged mid-session render as staged (and inverts the next toggle).

`since-base` is only offered when the base ref actually resolves — on a repo whose trunk isn't discoverable (`trunk`, no `origin/HEAD`) `getGitContext` omits it and the default falls through to `uncommitted`, so committed branch work is never silently hidden. The since-base patch/sections/fingerprint/file-content paths all degrade to `HEAD` together when merge-base fails for a resolvable-but-unrelated base. First-run shows `ReviewSetupDialog` (replaces the removed `DiffTypeSetupDialog`), which resets everyone to Git-status + since-base once and is reopenable from the review header menu. A one-time `GuideIntroDialog` (guided-reviews announcement) precedes it in the dialog chain (guide intro → look-and-feel → review setup); the three never stack.

### GitButler review invariants

GitButler is a distinct VCS provider, ordered after JJ and before Git in both Bun and Pi. It is selected only while symbolic `HEAD` is `refs/heads/gitbutler/workspace` (or legacy `gitbutler/integration`) and the repository has GitButler's local target-ref configuration; a leftover database or an ordinary branch with the reserved name is not detection. An active workspace requires `but >= 0.21.0` on `PATH`, and a missing/incompatible CLI is an explicit error rather than a fallback to ordinary Git staging against the synthetic workspace commit. `--gitbutler` forces this provider; `--git` remains the escape hatch.

The default `gitbutler:workspace` view is GitButler's reported merge base versus the working tree plus untracked files, so it includes every applied committed change and assigned/unassigned worktree change. Multi-branch stack views are committed-only merge-base→stack-tip Git diffs; branch views are committed-only first-parent segment diffs. Client IDs encode branch-name anchors, never GitButler's transient CLI IDs. Do not concatenate independent GitButler hunks: their bases can differ. Assigned worktree hunks stay in Workspace until GitButler exposes an authoritative combined stack diff.

GitButler assignment is not the Git index, so the provider never opts into stage/unstage. Git-status sections, commit history, remote-base discovery/fetch, and the first-run Git setup remain `vcsType: "git"` only. File expansion uses the exact object range for committed views and merge-base/working-tree pair for Workspace; fingerprints cover the visible Git content plus canonical stack/branch topology. Nested multi-repo mode maps only `workspace-current` to GitButler; staged/unstaged/last modes are unavailable when a GitButler child is present.

### Code-review Ask AI context

Ask AI's "changes under review" context for **code review** is generated by the shared agent-review prompt machine (`buildAgentReviewUserMessage` / `buildAgentReviewUserMessageForTarget` in `packages/server/agent-review-message.ts`) — the same machine the launchable review jobs use — and is **delivered on the user's messages, not the system prompt**. The review server computes it for the current view (`buildCurrentAiReviewContext` in `packages/server/review.ts`, mirrored in `apps/pi-extension/server/serverReview.ts`) and ships it as `aiReviewContext` in the diff payloads (`/api/diff` and the switch/PR endpoints). The client (`packages/review-editor`) latches it onto each question via `buildReviewContextPreamble` (`packages/ui/utils/aiPrompt.ts`): the full block on the first message and whenever the view changes, a short reminder otherwise (never re-pasting a large diff). This keeps the agent looking at exactly the on-screen changeset across every mode (uncommitted/untracked, branch, merge-base, stacked-PR full-stack, hide-whitespace, PR worktrees, workspace, GitButler, jj). The code-review system prompt (`buildCodeReviewPrompt` in `packages/ai/context.ts`) is intentionally role-only.

## Ask AI Provider Defaults

Ask AI providers are detected independently from installed/authenticated local CLIs, then the UI picks a default from the detected Ainotate origin. The mapping lives in `packages/core/agents.ts` (re-exported via the `packages/shared/agents.ts` shim) and is applied by `packages/ui/utils/aiProvider.ts`:

| Origin | Preferred Ask AI provider |
|--------|---------------------------|
| `claude-code` | `claude-agent-sdk` |
| `amp` | no dedicated provider; fallback to saved/server default |
| `droid` | no dedicated provider; fallback to saved/server default |
| `codex` | `codex-sdk` |
| `opencode` | `opencode-sdk` |
| `pi` | `pi-sdk` |
| `copilot-cli` | no dedicated provider; fallback to saved/server default |
| `gemini-cli` | no dedicated provider; fallback to saved/server default |

Per-origin choices are persisted in cookies, so a user can override the automatic match for one agent without changing the default for another.

> **Codex transport note:** the `codex-sdk` provider id is a stable identifier only — it no longer uses `@openai/codex-sdk` / `codex exec`. It drives a long-lived `codex app-server` process over JSON-RPC (`packages/ai/providers/codex-app-server.ts`), which respects the user's/enterprise-managed approval policy and supports interactive Allow/Deny approvals. The id stays `codex-sdk` to preserve saved cookie preferences, the `agents.ts` mapping, and the UI reasoning-effort gate.

## Annotate Flow

```
User runs /ainotate-annotate <file.md | file.html | https://... | folder/>
        ↓
Claude Code: ainotate annotate subcommand runs
OpenCode/Pi: event handler intercepts command
        ↓
Input type detected:
  .md/.mdx   → file read from disk
  .html/.htm → file read, rendered as raw HTML by default (or converted to markdown with --markdown)
  https://   → fetched via Jina Reader (default) or fetch+Turndown (--no-jina)
  folder/    → file browser opened, files converted on demand
        ↓
Annotate server starts (reuses plan editor HTML with mode:"annotate")
        ↓
User annotates content, provides feedback
        ↓
Send Annotations → feedback sent to agent session
```

## Archive Flow

```
User runs ainotate archive (CLI)
        ↓
Server starts in mode:"archive", reads ~/.ainotate/plans/
        ↓
Browser opens read-only archive viewer (sharing disabled)
        ↓
User browses saved plan decisions with approved/denied badges
        ↓
Done → POST /api/done closes the browser
```

During normal plan review, an Archive sidebar tab provides the same browsing via linked doc overlay without leaving the current session.

| `/api/external-annotations` | PATCH | Update fields on a single annotation (`?id=`) |
| `/api/external-annotations` | DELETE | Remove by `?id=`, `?source=`, or clear all |

### Review Server (`packages/server/review.ts`)

| Endpoint              | Method | Purpose                                    |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/api/diff`           | GET    | Returns `{ rawPatch, gitRef, snapshotId, origin, mode?, diffType, base, hideWhitespace, gitContext, agentCwd?, semanticDiff?, sections?, commitInfo?, baseBehindRemote? }`. `snapshotId` identifies this diff snapshot; the client echoes it on `/api/diff/fresh` probes (also returned by the switch/PR endpoints). `sections` is the since-base sidecar (Committed/Changes/Untracked partition); `commitInfo` is the commit-metadata sidecar (subject, markdown body, author + avatar) present only while a `commit:<sha>` diff is active; `baseBehindRemote` flags that the diff base is behind its remote tip. Workspace mode returns `mode: "workspace"` with folder-prefixed paths and no `gitContext`. |
| `/api/server-instance` | GET   | Returns the current opaque server instance id for persistent-tab reload detection |
| `/api/diff/switch`    | POST   | Switch diff type, base branch, or whitespace mode (body: `{ diffType, base?, hideWhitespace?, explicitBase? }` — `diffType` includes the `commit:<sha>` family). `explicitBase: true` marks a base the user picked from the picker — the server then honors it verbatim and permanently disables the bare-local-name → `origin/*` canonicalization for the session (echoed bases stay canonicalizable). Response includes `semanticDiff?`, `sections?`, `commitInfo?`, `baseBehindRemote?`, or `{ superseded: true }` when a newer concurrent switch has taken over (client ignores it). |
| `/api/commits`        | GET    | One page of the branch's linear `--first-parent` history for the Commits panel (`?limit=&before=`) → `{ commits, hasMore, base }`. Rows carry `isHead` / `isPastBase` (where the branch meets the active base) and best-effort author `avatarUrl`. Plain local git sessions only (PR/workspace/GitButler/jj/p4 → 400); computed against the active diff's cwd, so worktree sessions list the worktree's history. |
| `/api/diff/fresh`     | GET    | Cheap staleness probe: recomputes the VCS fingerprint captured with the current diff snapshot and returns `{ fresh, fingerprint?, baseBehindRemote?, agentCwd? }`. Accepts `?snapshot=<id>` — the client echoes the `snapshotId` it received with its diff, and a mismatch with the server's current snapshot reports stale PER CLIENT (covers the startup base upgrade and cross-tab switches even when the VCS fingerprint matches). `baseBehindRemote` is carried on every response (omitting it would flicker the "behind GitHub" banner); `agentCwd` re-advertises the PR checkout in PR mode. Unfingerprintable modes (e.g. P4) always report fresh to a matching snapshot. Polled by the UI's "Diff out of date · Refresh" notice. |
| `/api/fetch-base`     | POST   | Runs `git fetch` for the base's remote tracking ref, then re-queries the remote tip (fresh `ls-remote`) so narrow-refspec fetches report honestly. Backs the "Baseline is behind GitHub · Fetch" banner. Git-only, base-relative diff types only. |
| `/api/semantic-diff`  | GET    | Runs semantic diff for the active patch and returns parsed sem output or an unavailable/error response (`?fileExt=` / `?fileExts=` optional). |
| `/api/file-content`   | GET    | Returns `{ oldContent, newContent }` for expandable diff context (`?path=&oldPath=&base=`) |
| `/api/git-add`        | POST   | Stage/unstage a file (body: `{ filePath, undo? }`) |
| `/api/feedback`       | POST   | Submit review (body: feedback, annotations, agentSwitch) |
| `/api/image`          | GET    | Serve image by path query param            |
| `/api/upload`         | POST   | Upload image, returns `{ path, originalName }` |
| `/api/draft`          | GET/POST/DELETE | Auto-save annotation drafts to survive server crashes |
| `/api/editor-annotations` | GET | List editor annotations (VS Code only) |
| `/api/editor-annotation` | POST/DELETE | Add or remove an editor annotation (VS Code only) |
| `/api/ai/capabilities` | GET | Check if AI features are available |
| `/api/ai/session` | POST | Create or fork an AI session |
| `/api/ai/query` | POST | Send a message and stream the response (SSE) |
| `/api/ai/abort` | POST | Abort the current query |
| `/api/ai/permission` | POST | Respond to a permission request |
| `/api/ai/sessions` | GET | List active sessions |
| `/api/external-annotations/stream` | GET | SSE stream for real-time external annotations |
| `/api/external-annotations` | GET | Snapshot of external annotations (polling fallback, `?since=N` for version gating) |
| `/api/external-annotations` | POST | Add external annotations (single or batch `{ annotations: [...] }`) |
| `/api/external-annotations` | PATCH | Update fields on a single annotation (`?id=`) |
| `/api/external-annotations` | DELETE | Remove by `?id=`, `?source=`, or clear all |
| `/api/agents/capabilities` | GET | Check available agent providers (claude, codex, tour, guide, cursor, opencode, pi, copilot) |
| `/api/agents/review-profiles` | GET | List launchable review profiles (enabled skills + builtin default) |
| `/api/agents/skills` | GET | List all discovered skills for the add-a-review picker (each flagged `enabled`) |
| `/api/agents/review-skills` | POST | Enable a skill as a review (body: `{ name }`); writes `review-skills.json` |
| `/api/agents/jobs/stream` | GET | SSE stream for real-time agent job status updates |
| `/api/agents/jobs` | GET | Snapshot of agent jobs (polling fallback, `?since=N` for version gating) |
| `/api/agents/jobs` | POST | Launch an agent job (body: `{ provider, command, label, engine?, model?, effort?, reasoningEffort?, thinking?, fastMode?, reviewProfileId?, repairOf? }`) |
| `/api/agents/jobs` | DELETE | Kill all running agent jobs |
| `/api/agents/jobs/:id` | DELETE | Kill a specific agent job |
| `/api/pr-diff-scope` | POST | Switch between layer and full-stack diff scope. Response includes `semanticDiff?`. |
| `/api/pr-list` | GET | List PRs for the current repo (cached 30s) |
| `/api/pr-switch` | POST | Switch to a different PR in-place (body: `{ url }`). Response includes `semanticDiff?`. |
| `/api/tour/:jobId` | GET | Fetch Code Tour result (greeting, stops, checklist) for a completed tour job |
| `/api/tour/:jobId/checklist` | PUT | Persist checklist item state for a Code Tour |
| `/api/guide/:jobId` | GET | Fetch Guided Review result (ordered sections with overviews + file refs) for a completed guide job |
| `/api/guide/:jobId/reviewed` | PUT | Persist per-section reviewed state for a guide |
| `/api/guide/:jobId/output` | GET | Fetch a failed guide job's captured raw output for manual repair (404 if none captured) |
| `/api/guide/:jobId/submit` | POST | Manually submit corrected guide JSON for a failed job (body: `{ payload }`) |
| `/api/code-nav/resolve` | POST | Search for symbol definitions and references via ripgrep (body: `{ symbol, filePath, line, charStart, side, language? }`) |
| `/api/code-nav/file` | GET | Read file from working tree for code-nav preview (`?path=`) |

### Annotate Server (`packages/server/annotate.ts`)

| Endpoint              | Method | Purpose                                    |
| --------------------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| `/api/plan`           | GET    | Returns `{ plan, origin, mode: "annotate", filePath, sourceInfo?, gate, renderAs?, rawHtml?, previousPlan?, versionInfo?, diffCurrent?, diffHtml? }`. The last four power the per-file version diff: `previousPlan`/`versionInfo`/`diffCurrent` for the markdown diff, `diffHtml` (the previous→current page rendered with inline `<ins>`/`<del>`) for `--render-html` files. |
| `/api/plan/version`   | GET    | Fetch a specific stored version of the annotated file (`?v=N`) |
| `/api/plan/versions`  | GET    | List all stored versions of the annotated file |
| `/api/feedback`       | POST   | Submit annotations (body: feedback, annotations) |
| `/api/approve`        | POST   | Approve without feedback (review-gate UX, `--gate`) |
| `/api/exit`           | POST   | Close session without feedback |
| `/api/save-notes`     | POST   | Save to external note apps (Obsidian, Bear, Octarine) |

| `/api/doc/exists`     | POST   | Batch-validate code-file paths (body: `{ paths: string[], base?: string }`) |
| `/api/draft`          | GET/POST/DELETE | Auto-save annotation drafts to survive server crashes |
| `/api/agent-terminal/pty/<token>` | WebSocket | Tokenized PTY bridge for the optional annotate-mode agent terminal |
| `/api/ai/capabilities` | GET | Check if AI features are available |
| `/api/ai/session` | POST | Create or fork an AI session |
| `/api/ai/query` | POST | Send a message and stream the response (SSE) |

All servers use random ports locally or fixed port (`19432`) in remote mode.

## Plan Version History

Every plan is automatically saved to `~/.ainotate/history/{project}/{slug}/` on arrival, before the user sees the UI. Versions are numbered sequentially (`001.md`, `002.md`, etc.). The slug is derived from the plan's first `# Heading` + today's date via `generateSlug()`, scoped by project name (git repo or cwd). Same heading on the same day = same slug = same plan being iterated on. Identical resubmissions are deduplicated (no new file if content matches the latest version).

This powers the version history API (`/api/plan/version`, `/api/plan/versions`) and the plan diff system.

**Annotate mode** also saves history on open, so the same version diff works when annotating a standalone `.md`/`.txt`/`.html` file. It keys the slug by **file path** — `annotate-{sanitized-basename}-{hash8}` — rather than heading + date, so re-opening the same file groups its versions even as its content (and headings) change. **Note this writes a copy of each annotated file's content** under `~/.ainotate/history/` (or `AINOTATE_DATA_DIR`); disable via `AINOTATE_ANNOTATE_HISTORY=0` or `{ "annotateHistory": false }` in `~/.ainotate/config.json` to keep annotate sessions stateless (the version diff is then unavailable). For `--render-html` files the diff is rendered as the real page with inline `<ins>`/`<del>` highlights via `htmlDiff()` (`packages/shared/html-diff.ts`).

History saves independently of the `planSave` user setting (which controls decision snapshots in `~/.ainotate/plans/`). Storage functions live in `packages/shared/storage.ts` (runtime-agnostic, re-exported by `packages/server/storage.ts`). Pi copies the shared files at build time. Slug format: `{sanitized-heading}-YYYY-MM-DD` (heading first for readability).

## Plan Diff

When a user denies a plan and Claude resubmits, the UI shows what changed between versions. A `+N/-M` badge appears below the document card; clicking it toggles between normal view and diff view.

**Diff engine** (`packages/ui/utils/planDiffEngine.ts`): Uses the `diff` npm package (`diffLines()`) to compute line-level diffs. Groups consecutive remove+add into "modified" blocks. Returns `PlanDiffBlock[]` and `PlanDiffStats`.

**Two view modes** (toggle via `PlanDiffModeSwitcher`):
- **Rendered** (`PlanCleanDiffView`): Color-coded left borders — green (added), red (removed/strikethrough), yellow (modified)
- **Raw** (`PlanRawDiffView`): Monospace `+/-` lines, git-style

**State** (`packages/ui/hooks/usePlanDiff.ts`): Manages base version selection, diff computation, and version fetching. The server sends `previousPlan` with the initial `/api/plan` response; the hook auto-diffs against it. Users can select any prior version from the sidebar Version Browser.

**Diff annotations:** The clean diff view supports block-level annotation — hover over added/removed/modified sections to annotate entire blocks. Annotations carry a `diffContext` field (`added`/`removed`/`modified`). Exported feedback includes `[In diff content]` labels.

**Annotation hook** (`packages/ui/hooks/useAnnotationHighlighter.ts`): Annotation infrastructure used by `Viewer.tsx`. Manages web-highlighter lifecycle, toolbar/popover state, annotation creation, text-based restoration, and scroll-to-selected. The diff view uses its own block-level hover system instead.

**Sidebar** (`packages/ui/hooks/useSidebar.ts`): Shared left sidebar with three tabs — Table of Contents, Version Browser, and Archive. The "Auto-open Sidebar" setting controls whether it opens on load (TOC tab only). In archive mode, the sidebar opens to the Archive tab automatically.

## Data Types

**Location:** `packages/ui/types.ts`

```typescript
enum AnnotationType {
  DELETION = "DELETION",
  COMMENT = "COMMENT",
  GLOBAL_COMMENT = "GLOBAL_COMMENT",
}

interface ImageAttachment {
  path: string;   // temp file path
  name: string;   // human-readable label (e.g., "login-mockup")
}

interface Annotation {
  id: string;
  blockId: string;
  startOffset: number;
  endOffset: number;
  type: AnnotationType;
  text?: string; // For comment
  originalText: string; // The selected text
  createdA: number; // Timestamp
  author?: string; // Tater identity
  images?: ImageAttachment[]; // Attached images with names
  source?: string; // External tool identifier (e.g., "eslint") — set when annotation comes from external API
  diffContext?: 'added' | 'removed' | 'modified'; // Set when annotation created in plan diff view
  startMeta?: { parentTagName; parentIndex; textOffset };
  endMeta?: { parentTagName; parentIndex; textOffset };
}

interface Block {
  id: string;
  type: "paragraph" | "heading" | "blockquote" | "list-item" | "code" | "hr" | "table" | "html" | "directive";
  content: string;
  level?: number; // For headings (1-6)
  language?: string; // For code blocks
  alertKind?: "note" | "tip" | "warning" | "caution" | "important"; // GitHub alerts (blockquote subtype)
  order: number;
  startLine: number;
}
```

## Markdown Parser

**Location:** `packages/ui/utils/parser.ts`

`parseMarkdownToBlocks(markdown)` splits markdown into Block objects. Handles:

- Headings (`#`, `##`, etc.) with slug-derived anchor ids
- Code blocks (``` with language extraction)
- List items (`-`, `*`, `1.`)
- Blockquotes (`>`) — including GitHub alerts (`> [!NOTE|TIP|WARNING|CAUTION|IMPORTANT]`) which set `alertKind`
- Horizontal rules (`---`)
- Tables (pipe-delimited) — rendered via `TableBlock` with a `TableToolbar` (copy as markdown/CSV) and `TablePopout` overlay
- Raw HTML blocks (`<details>`, `<summary>`, etc.) — rendered via `HtmlBlock` through `marked` + DOMPurify
- Directive containers (`:::kind ... :::`) — rendered via `Callout`
- Paragraphs (default) with inline extras: bare URL autolinks, `@mentions` / `#issue-refs`, emoji shortcodes, smart punctuation

`exportAnnotations(blocks, annotations, globalAttachments)` generates human-readable feedback for Claude. Images are referenced by name: `[image-name] /tmp/path...`. Annotations with `diffContext` include `[In diff content]` labels.

## Annotation System

**Selection mode:** User selects text → toolbar appears → choose annotation type
**Redline mode:** User selects text → auto-creates DELETION annotation

Text highlighting uses `web-highlighter` library. Code blocks use manual `<mark>` wrapping (web-highlighter can't select inside `<pre>`).

## Keyboard Shortcuts

**Location:** `packages/ui/shortcuts/` (engine + scope data), `packages/editor/shortcuts.ts` and `packages/review-editor/shortcuts.ts` (per-app surfaces).

The shortcut system has three layers:

1. **Engine** (`packages/ui/shortcuts/{core,runtime}.ts`) — parser for declarative bindings (`Mod+Enter`, `Alt Alt` double-tap, `Alt hold`), dispatcher, platform-aware formatter (mac glyphs vs. `Ctrl`), validator, and the `useShortcutScope` / `useDoubleTapShortcuts` React hooks. Truly shared — both apps use it as-is.
2. **Scopes** — `defineShortcutScope({ id, title, shortcuts: { actionId: { bindings, description, section, ... } } })`. One scope per UI surface (annotation toolbar, comment popover, file tree, etc.). Lives in `packages/ui/shortcuts/{plan-review,code-review}/` — **the subfolder names which app's UI the scope serves**. Components/Apps wire handlers to a scope via `useShortcutScope({ scope, handlers: { actionId: () => ... } })`.
3. **Surfaces** (`packages/editor/shortcuts.ts`, `packages/review-editor/shortcuts.ts`) — each app composes its scopes into a `ShortcutSurface` (`planReviewSurface`, `annotateSurface`, `codeReviewSurface`). Surfaces feed the in-app help modal.

**Convention for adding new shortcuts:** define the action in the relevant scope file under the right subfolder (`plan-review/` or `code-review/`), declare the binding(s) and description, then wire a handler at the call site with `useShortcutScope`. Unit tests in `packages/ui/shortcuts.test.ts` enforce normalized binding tokens (`Mod`, `Shift`, `Alt`, `A-Z`, `1-0`, named keys, `F1`–`F12`) and unique scope ids.

## URL Sharing

**Location:** `packages/ui/utils/sharing.ts`, `packages/ui/hooks/useSharing.ts`

Shares full plan + annotations via URL hash using deflate compression.

**Payload format:**

```typescript
// Image in shareable format: plain string (old) or [path, name] tuple (new)
type ShareableImage = string | [string, string];

interface SharePayload {
  p: string; // Plan markdown
  a: ShareableAnnotation[]; // Compact annotations
  g?: ShareableImage[]; // Global attachments
  d?: (string | null)[]; // diffContext per annotation, parallel to `a`
  s?: (string | undefined)[]; // source per annotation (external tool identifier), parallel to `a`
  h?: string; // Raw HTML content (direct HTML rendering mode)
  r?: 'html'; // Render mode flag (omitted = markdown)
}

type ShareableAnnotation =
  | ["D", string, string | null, ShareableImage[]?] // [type, original, author, images?]
  | ["C", string, string, string | null, ShareableImage[]?] // [type, original, comment, author, images?]
  | ["G", string, string | null, ShareableImage[]?]; // [type, comment, author, images?]
```

**Compression pipeline:**

1. `JSON.stringify(payload)`
2. `CompressionStream('deflate-raw')`
3. Base64 encode
4. URL-safe: replace `+/=` with `-_`

**On load from shared URL:**

1. Parse hash, decompress, restore annotations
2. Find text positions in rendered DOM via text search
3. Apply `<mark>` highlights
4. Clear hash from URL (prevents re-parse on refresh)

## Settings Persistence

**Location:** `packages/ui/utils/storage.ts`, `planSave.ts`, `agentSwitch.ts`

Uses cookies (not localStorage) because each hook invocation runs on a random port. Settings include identity, plan saving (enabled/custom path), and agent switching (OpenCode only).

## Syntax Highlighting

Code blocks use bundled `highlight.js`. Language is extracted from fence (```rust) and applied as `language-{lang}`class. Each block highlighted individually via`hljs.highlightElement()`.

## Requirements

- Bun runtime
- Claude Code with plugin/hooks support, or OpenCode
- Cross-platform: macOS (`open`), Linux (`xdg-open`), Windows (`start`)

## Development

```bash
bun install

# Run any app
bun run dev:hook       # Hook server (plan review)
bun run dev:review     # Review editor (code review)
bun run dev:portal     # Portal editor
bun run dev:vscode     # VS Code extension (watch mode)
```

**Local `ainotate` command:** run `bun link` once in the checkout to make the global `ainotate` command use this repo's source (`apps/hook/server/index.ts`) instead of an installed release binary. Commands like `ainotate review` then reflect local changes immediately. Rebuild the bundled HTML when changing UI code (see Build below).

## Build

```bash
bun run build:hook       # Single-file HTML for hook server
bun run build:review     # Code review editor
bun run build:opencode   # OpenCode plugin (copies HTML from hook + review)
bun run build:portal     # Static build for share.ainotate.ai
bun run build:vscode     # VS Code extension bundle
bun run package:vscode   # Package .vsix for marketplace
bun run build            # Build hook + opencode (main targets)
```

**Important: Tailwind `@source` paths.** When creating new directories that contain `.tsx` files with Tailwind classes, add a matching `@source` entry to the app's `index.css`. Tailwind only generates CSS for classes it finds in scanned files — missing paths means classes appear in the DOM but have no effect.

**Important: Build order matters.** The hook build (`build:hook`) copies pre-built HTML from `apps/review/dist/`. If you change UI code in `packages/ui/`, `packages/editor/`, or `packages/review-editor/`, you **must** rebuild the review app first, then the hook:

```bash
bun run --cwd apps/review build && bun run build:hook   # For review UI changes
bun run build:hook                                       # For plan UI changes only
bun run build:hook && bun run build:opencode             # For OpenCode plugin
```

Running only `build:hook` after review-editor changes will copy stale HTML files. When testing locally with a compiled binary, the full sequence is:

```bash
bun run --cwd apps/review build && bun run build:hook && \
  bun build apps/hook/server/index.ts --compile --outfile ~/.local/bin/ainotate
```

Running only `build:opencode` will copy stale HTML files.

## Test plugin locally

```
claude --plugin-dir ./apps/hook
```
