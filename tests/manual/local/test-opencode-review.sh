# Test script to simulate OpenCode code review
#
# Usage:
#   ./test-opencode-review.sh
#
# What it does:
#   1. Builds the review app (ensures latest code)
#   2. Runs the review server with opencode origin
#   3. Opens browser for you to test the UI (should show "OpenCode" badge + "Send Feedback" button)
#   4. Prints the result (feedback)
