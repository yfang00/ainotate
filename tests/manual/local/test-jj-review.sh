# Test script for JJ local review support.
#
# Usage:
#   ./tests/manual/local/test-jj-review.sh [--keep] [--setup-only]
#
# Options:
#   --keep        Don't clean up the temp repo after the review session exits.
#   --setup-only  Create the JJ sandbox and print useful commands without
#                 launching the browser review UI. Implies --keep.
#
# What it does:
#   1. Builds the review app.
#   2. Creates a local bare Git remote that acts like a tiny GitHub origin.
#   3. Clones it with `jj git clone --colocate`.
#   4. Creates a committed JJ change and a current working-copy change.
#   5. Launches the real review server through the VCS abstraction.
