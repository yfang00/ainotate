# Test script to simulate OpenCode origin
#
# Usage:
#   ./test-hook-2.sh
#
# What it does:
#   1. Builds the hook (ensures latest code)
#   2. Runs the test server with opencode origin
#   3. Opens browser for you to test the UI (should show blue "OpenCode" badge)
#   4. Prints the result (approved/denied)
