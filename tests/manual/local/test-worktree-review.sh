# Test script for worktree support and expandable diff context in code review
#
# Usage:
#   ./test-worktree-review.sh [--keep]
#
# Options:
#   --keep  Don't clean up the temp repo on exit (for debugging)
#
# What it does:
#   1. Builds the review app (ensures latest code)
#   2. Creates a temp git repo with:
#      - Main repo: 6 uncommitted changes including disjoint hunks, deleted file,
#        renamed file, and new file (for expandable diff context testing)
#      - 4 worktrees: feature-auth, fix-parser, empty-branch, detached HEAD
#   3. Launches review server — browser opens automatically
#   4. You test worktree dropdown, diff switching, and expandable context
#   5. Cleans up on exit (unless --keep)
